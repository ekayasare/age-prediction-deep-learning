# Age Prediction with Deep Learning

This project trains a convolutional neural network (ResNet50) to predict human age from images.  
Part of my AI/ML bootcamp work demonstrating computer vision and deep learning model deployment.

## Tech Stack
- Python, TensorFlow/Keras
- ResNet50, CNNs
- ImageDataGenerator for preprocessing
- GPU training

## Results
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): **7.8 years** (beating the target ≤8)

# Taxi Demand Forecasting

This project builds a time-series forecasting model to predict hourly taxi orders, helping optimize driver allocation.  
Demonstrates time-series feature engineering and regression modeling.

## Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (Random Forest, Linear Regression)
- Time-series feature engineering

## Results
- RMSE: **47** (meeting requirement ≤48)
